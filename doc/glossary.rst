NEST-specific terms
-------------------
.. one refers to these things by putting the right quote into | | signs, like |model|
   these shortcuts are defined in the /glossary_include.rst file, which must be included in all files that use a glossary entry.
.. TODO include glossary.rst in toctree

.. _glossary_model:

Model
~~~~~
An abstract representation of a neural network's component in NEST. NEST models comprise neuron models, synapse models, generators, and recording devices (models). TODO more?

Let's check if LaTeX is rendered: :math:`I(t) = I_mean + I_std*W(t)`

.. _glossary_status_dictionary:

Status dictionary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Also referred to by the name "parameter dictionary" (TODO change/unique name in doc), contains all parameters of the 

.. _glossary_model_dictionary:

Model dictionary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
NOT the status/parameter dictionary! TODO is/where is this used?

.. _glossary_kernel:

Kernel
~~~~~~
The component of NEST that performs the simulations. A user defining a neural simulation in Python interacts with it using the |PyNEST| API. Careful! In some model documentations, terms like "post-synaptic kernel" are used referring to integral kernels.

.. _glossary_pynest:

PyNEST
~~~~~~
A Python module allowing a Python script to interact with the NEST |kernel|. Documented in TODO reference to PyNEST tutorial, TODO reference to PyNEST API.

.. _glossary_sli:

SLI
~~~
Short for *Simulation Language Interpreter*, the low-level language (and interpreter of that language) to interact with the NEST kernel.

static synapse type
